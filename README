The attached zip file contains all of the source and compiled code to produce solutions

Copy the zip file to an energon machine and unzip:
> unzip SATSolver.zip
> cd SATSolver

The SATSolver.jar in this directory is the tool used to generate solutions.
You can invoke it with two command line arguments <input> <output>:
> java -jar SATSolver.jar sat_8_0.txt sat_8_0_soln.txt

If necessary you can rebuild the jar file by using the included ant build script:
> ant clean
> ant

Other Helpful Hints:
We also supplied an automation script which can generate results for all problem sets
and evaluate the results.  Assuming that all of the inputs are in:
	data/prob0
	data/prob1
	data/prob2
	data/prob3
and that the evaluator program is located at:
	spec/evaluator.jar

Then you can run:
$ test_and_score_all.sh
This will store solutions in soln/ and output results for each test.
